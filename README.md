# PewPewzBot
Discord bot I have made for our small server. 
The bot saves some data on postgresSQL. It is currently set up to accomodate one server for the database.

It is currently able to do below as of 13.03.21:

* '!stock GME' - Stock prices, GME = GameStop for example
* '!price BTC USD' - Currency exchange, BTC = BitCoin for example. Second currency optional, default is USD'
* '!pixelplanet' - Scrapes and sends random pixel planet from https://www.mypixelplanet.com/
* '!bingo score' - Current bingo scores
* '!bingo add word' - Adds "word" to bingo game
* '!bingo info word' - Gives info on "word"
* '!bingo remove word' - Removes "word" from the game
* !bingo game checks over the messages looking for added keywords and crosses them off in the process. Game reset on completion.
